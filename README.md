DNA analysis of Mitochondrial Hypervariable Regions (HVR) using Python

# Mitochondrial DNA Hypervariable Regions Analysis (HVR1 & HVR2)

This repository contains my project **"HVRs_DNA_analysis.ipynb"**, which was done as a part of "AI in Biotechnology:Fundamentals to Frontiers" course through Biogrademy

# Project Overview
The project focuses on analyzing the **hypervariable regions (HVR1 and HVR2)** of the **human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)**.  
These regions are known for their high mutation rate and are widely used in:
- **Forensic science** (when the primary nuclear DNA is degraded or not sufficient for analysis
- **Maternal lineage studies**
- **Identification of victims in natural disasters**

# The project involves-
- fetching mtDNA sequences
- extracting HVR1 and HVR2 regions
- performing sequence composition analysis
- comparing them with the standard **rCRS (revised Cambridge Reference Sequence)**
- Formation of mutation profiles of two individuals and comparing them

# Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **pandas** for data analysis and tabulation  
- **matplotlib** fo data visualization (plots and graphs)
- **Counter** for performing compostion analysis

# Key Analyses Performed
1. Extracted **HVR1 (16024â€“16383)** and **HVR2 (57â€“372)** regions from the mitochondrial genome.  
2. Calculated:
   - Length of each region  
   - Nucleotide composition (%A, %T, %G, %C)  
   - GC content (%)  
3. Visualized nucleotide composition and GC distribution using bar charts. 
4. Compared HVR1 and HVR2 sequences across individuals against the **rCRS** reference to form mutation profiles and compare them.

# Learnings from this project
- Practical application of Python and involved libraries in **DNA sequence analysis**
- Basics of **bioinformatics and DNA sequence analysis**
- Using **Google Colab** and **GitHub** for data-driven biology
